# Dashboard Backend

A simple backend for the **Dashboard Project**, built using **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**.  
The project was developed as a complement to the front-end assignment, providing real API endpoints instead of mocked data.  
It focuses on exposing only the data required by the dashboard components, with initial data seeded for demonstration purposes.
